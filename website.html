        <p id="info_on_chess">Chess is a board game for two players.
             It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).<br><br>

            Chess is an abstract strategy game which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance.<br>
             It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 64 squares arranged in an 8 by 8 grid.<br>
              The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.<br>
               White moves first, followed by Black; then moves alternate. The object of the game is to checkmate (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king.<br>
             There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.<br><br>
            
            The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India.<br>
             After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century,<br>
              with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide.<br><br>
            
            Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs;<br>
             the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886;<br>
              Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion (2024).<br><br>
            
            A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.<br>
             Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts,<br>
              and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology.<br>
               One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.<br>
                In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov.<br>
                 Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory;<br>
                  however, chess is not a solved game.</p>
