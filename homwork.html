        <p id="info_tennis">Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).<br>
             Each player uses a tennis racket strung with a cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.<br>
              The object is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.<br>
             If a player is unable to return the ball successfully, the opponent scores a point.<br><br>

            Playable at all levels of society and at all ages, tennis can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users.<br>
             The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages.<br>
              The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.<br>
               It had close connections to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.<br><br>
            
            The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,<br>
             and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.<br>
              A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system,<br>
              which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.<br><br>
            
            Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is a popular worldwide spectator sport.<br>
             The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the majors) are especially popular and are considered the highest level of competition for the sport.<br>
              These tournaments are the Australian Open, played on hardcourts; the French Open, played on red clay courts; Wimbledon, played on grass courts; and the US Open,<br>
               also played on hardcourts.[12] Additionally, tennis was one of the original Olympic sports, and has been consistently competed in the Summer Olympic Games since 1988.</p>
